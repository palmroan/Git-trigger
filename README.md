# CI/CD Web App with React and Python

This project is built with **React** for the frontend and **Python** for the backend. The primary goal of this project is to implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that integrates with Git repositories. This setup streamlines the process of pushing code changes and provides a user interface (UI) to manage and deploy code to the server.

**Please note: This project is still under construction.**

## Features

- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code from Git repositories to the server.
- **User Interface:** A React-based UI allows users to easily manage the deployment process, ensuring that code can be pushed to the server with minimal friction.
- **Backend with Python:** Handles the CI/CD logic, connects to the Git repositories, and manages deployments to the server.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Python
- **Version Control:** Git
